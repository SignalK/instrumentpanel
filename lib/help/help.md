**0. Introduction** [Back to main menu](#content)  
___
**Signal K InstrumentPanel** is implemented as a grid with draggable &amp; resizable cells.  
Each cell also called widget is in charge of displaying the value(s) of a Signal K path.  
When a new path is discovered, a new dedicated widget is created and attached to this path. It automatically becomes visible or not on the grid according to a configurable rule.  
For some data, like wind, there is a composite gauge that displays several items in the same time widget.  
The cells are grouped into three columns:
- navigation
- environment
- everything else (electrical, propulsion etc)
  
>
>![demo](./help/main-page.png#maxwidth)  
>
<a id="0_help"></a>
When the help page is displayed all buttons are disabled.  
You must close the help page by clicking on the ![help-on](./help/help-on-icon.png)
 button to reactivate them.  
  
<a id="1"></a>
**1. Connect to your Signal K Server** [Back to main menu](#content)  
___
The Signal K server address is directly derived from your web page and InstrumentPanel automatically connects to the server.  
>
>![connect](./help/connecting.png#maxwidth)  
>
  
If the _Reconnecting_ reappears, it means that the connection
 to the Signal K server is broken and that InstrumentPanel
 is trying to reconnect automatically.  
  
For advanced users, you can manually specify the address and
 the protocol to connect to your Signal K server
 (See: [Advanced options](#5)).  
  
<a id="2"></a>
**2. Top Bar Buttons** [Back to main menu](#content)  
___
After connecting an initial first page is auto generated with all paths known in your SignalK Server.
Signal K data items are displayed in different cells with dedicated widgets depending on their types.
Widgets are arranged on a virtual grid with vertical compaction.  
**Units** on widgets are set to default and fetched from the server metadata.
